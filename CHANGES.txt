 Release Notes
===============

**2.16.11a4**

* Added moving of log directory from var/log -> log, and replacement of var directory with a symlink.
* Added setting of passwords by default for broker users by sr_audit.
* Added --reset flag interpretation by sr_audit so that permissions can be updated easily for all users.
  So now when upgrading after 'log' -> 'report' transition, just do:
    
  ``sr_audit --reset True --users foreground``
    
  and it will overwrite all the permission regexp's of the broker users.
  If someone has funny permissions, that could be a problem.  
* Added 'set_passwords' flag to sr_audit, defaulting to True.
  if set to false, users are given blank passwords.... not sure if this is useful.
  trying to understand what to do with this in the case of LDAP based users.  
* Added creation of send directory to flow_setup.sh 
* un-commented the over-ride default exchange for reporting in tsource2send.conf...
  it still needs overriding.  
* Corrected the regexp permission masks to allow sources to write to any
  exchange that starts with xs_<user>... rather than just specifically that source.  
* Corrected the regexp permissions to allow reading by subs from same.  
* Reverted patch in sarra that broke download URL's.
* Add old log exchanges to sr_audit for compatibility with pre-transition clients.
* Changed test of sender to compare against the ones watch, rather than subscriber.
* Added measurable test to flow test for sender.
* Adding sr_watch to flow_test.
* Added sr_sender to flow test.
* Removing '/var' so log files are in the normal place now.
