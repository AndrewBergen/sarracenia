SYNOPSIS
========

**sr_watch** [ *-pbu|--post_base_url url* ] [ *-pb|--post_broker broker_url* ]...[ *-p|--path* ] [reload|restart|start|status|stop] [path]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Watches a directory and publishes posts when files in the directory change
(are added, modified, or deleted.) Its arguments are very similar to  `sr_post <sr_post.1.html>`_.
In the MetPX-Sarracenia suite, the main goal is to post the availability and readiness
of one's files. Subscribers use  *sr_subscribe*  to consume the post and download the files.

Posts are sent to an AMQP server, also called a broker, specified with the option [ *-b|--broker broker_url* ]. 

CREDENTIAL OPTIONS
------------------

The broker option sets all the credential information to connect to the  **RabbitMQ** server

- **broker amqp{s}://<user>:<pw>@<brokerhost>[:port]/<vhost>**

::

      (default: amqp://anonymous:anonymous@dd.weather.gc.ca/ ) 

All sr\_ tools store all sensitive authentication info in the credentials.conf file.
Passwords for SFTP, AMQP, and HTTP accounts are stored in URLÂ´s there, as well as other pointers
to thins such as private keys, or FTP modes.

For more details, see: `sr_subscribe(1) credentials <sr_subscribe.1.html#credentials>`_

Mandatory Settings
------------------

The [*-u|--url url*] option specifies the protocol, credentials, host and port to which subscribers 
will connect to get the file. 

format of argument to the *url* option::

       [ftp|http|sftp]://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/
       or
       [ftp|http|sftp]://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/
       or
       file:


The [*-p|--path path*] option tells *sr_watch* what to look for.
If the *path* specifies a directory, *sr_watches* create a posts for any time
a file in that directory that is created, modified or deleted. 
If the *path* specifies a file,  *sr_watch*  watches that only that file.
In the announcement, it is specified with the *path* of the product.
There is usually one post per file.


An example of an excution of  *sr_watch*  checking a file::

 sr_watch -s sftp://stanley@mysftpserver.com/ -p /data/shared/products/foo -b amqp://broker.com -action start

Here,  *sr_watch*  checks events on the file /data/shared/products/foo.
Default events settings reports if the file the file is modified or deleted.
When the file gets modified,  *sr_watch*  reads the file /data/shared/products/foo
and calculates its checksum.  It then builds a post message, logs into broker.com as user 'guest' (default credentials)
and sends the post to defaults vhost '/' and exchange 'xs_stanley' (default exchange)

A subscriber can download the file /data/shared/products/foo  by logging as user stanley
on mysftpserver.com using the sftp protocol to  broker.com assuming he has proper credentials.

The output of the command is as follows ::

 [INFO] v02.post.data.shared.products.foo '20150813161959.854 sftp://stanley@mysftpserver.com/ /data/shared/products/foo'
       source=guest parts=1,256,1,0,0 sum=d,fc473c7a2801babbd3818260f50859de 

In MetPX-Sarracenia, each post is published under a certain topic.
After the '[INFO]' the next information gives the \fBtopic*  of the
post. Topics in  *AMQP*  are fields separated by dot. In MetPX-Sarracenia 
it is made of a  *topic_prefix*  by default : version  *V02* , an action  *post* ,
followed by the  *subtopic*  by default : the file path separated with dots, here, *data.shared.products.foo* 

After the topic hierarchy comes the body of the notification.  It consists of a time  *20150813161959.854* , 
and the source url of the file in the last 2 fields.

The remaining line gives informations that are placed in the amqp message header.
Here it consists of  *source=guest* , which is the amqp user,  *parts=1,256,0,0,1* ,
which suggest to download the file in 1 part of 256 bytes (the actual filesize), trailing 1,0,0
gives the number of block, the remaining in bytes and the current 
block.  *sum=d,fc473c7a2801babbd3818260f50859de*  mentions checksum information,
here,  *d*  means md5 checksum performed on the data, and  *fc473c7a2801babbd3818260f50859de* 
is the checksum value.  When the event on a file is a deletion, sum=R,0  R stands for remove.

Another example watching a file::

 sr_watch -dr /data/web/public_data -s http://dd.weather.gc.ca/ -p bulletins/alphanumeric/SACN32_CWAO_123456 -b amqp://broker.com -action start

By default, sr_watch checks the file /data/web/public_data/bulletins/alphanumeric/SACN32_CWAO_123456
(concatenating the base_dir and relative path of the source url to obtain the local file path).
If the file changes, it calculates its checksum. It then builds a post message, logs into broker.com as user 'guest'
(default credentials) and sends the post to defaults vhost '/' and exchange 'sx_guest' (default exchange)

A subscriber can download the file http://dd.weather.gc.ca/bulletins/alphanumeric/SACN32_CWAO_123456 using http
without authentication on dd.weather.gc.ca.

An example checking a directory::

 sr_watch -dr /data/web/public_data -s http://dd.weather.gc.ca/ -p bulletins/alphanumeric -b amqp://broker.com -action start

Here, sr_watch checks for file creation(modification) in /data/web/public_data/bulletins/alphanumeric
(concatenating the base_dir and relative path of the source url to obtain the directory path).
If the file SACN32_CWAO_123456 is being created in that directory, sr_watch calculates its checksum.
It then builds a post message, logs into broker.com as user 'guest' 
(default credentials) and sends the post to exchange 'amq.topic' (default exchange)

A subscriber can download the created/modified file http://dd.weather.gc.ca/bulletins/alphanumeric/SACN32_CWAO_123456 using http
without authentication on dd.weather.gc.ca.

ARGUMENTS AND OPTIONS
=====================

Please refer to the `sr_subscribe(1) <sr_subscribe.1.html>`_ manual page for a detailed description of
common settings, and methods of specifying them.

**[--blocksize <value>]**

the value should be one of::

   0 - autocompute an appropriate partitioning strategy (default)
   1 - always send files in a single part.
   p,<sz> - used a fixed partition size (example size: 1M )

Files can be announced as multiple blocks (or parts.) Each part has a separate checksum.
The parts and their checksums are stored in the cache. Partitions can traverse
the network separately, and in paralllel.  When files change, transfers are
optimized by only sending parts which have changed.

The autocomputation algorithm determines a blocksize that encourages a reasonable number of parts
for files of various sizes.  As the file size varies, the automatic computation will give different
results. This will result in resending information which has not changed as partitions of a different
size will have different sums.  Where large files are being appended to, it make sense to specify a 
fixed partition size. 

In cases where a custom downloader is used which does not understand partitioning, it is necessary
to avoid having the file split into parts, so one would specify '1' to force all files to be send
as a single part.

The value of the *blocksize*  is an integer that may be followed by  letter designator *[B|K|M|G|T]* meaning:
for Bytes, Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, Terabytes respectively.  All theses references are powers of 2.

**[-b|--broker <broker>]**
       *broker*  is the broker to connect to to send the post.

**[-c|--config <configfile>]**
       A file filled with options.

**[--delete <boolean>]**

In force_polling mode, assume that directories empty themselves, so that every file in each *path*
should be posted at every polling pass, instead of just new ones.

**[-pbd|--post_base_dir <path>]**

The  *base_dir*  option supplies the directory path that,
when combined with the relative one from  *source url* , 
gives the local absolute path to the data file to be posted.
.fi

**[-e|--events <event|event|...>]**

A list of event types to monitor separated by a 'pipe symbol'.
Available events:  create, delete, follow, link, modify, poll
Default: default is all of them, except poll

The *create*, *modify*, and *delete* events reflect what is expected: a file being created, modified, or deleted.
If *link* is set, symbolic links will be posted as links so that consumers can choose 
how to process them. if it is not set, then no symbolic link events will ever be posted.

.. note::
   move or rename events are treated as modify events

**[-ex|--exchange <exchange>]**

By default, the exchange used is amq.topic. This exchange is provided on broker
for general usage. It can be overwritten with this  *exchange*  option

**[-fp|--force_polling <boolean>]**

By Default, sr_watch selects a (OS dependent) optimal method to watch a directory.   For large trees,
the optimal method can be manyfold (10x or even 100x) faster to recognize when a file has been modified.
In some cases, however, platform optimal methods do not work (such as with some network shares, or distributed 
file systems), so one must use a slower but more reliable and portable polling method.  The *force_polling* 
keyword causes sr_watch to select the polling method in spite of the availability of a normally better one.
FIXME: KNOWN LIMITATION: When *force_polling* is set, the *sleep* setting, should be at least 5 seconds.
not clear why.   

NOTE::

  When directories are consumed by processes using the subscriber *delete* option, they stay empty, and
  every file should be reported on every pass.  When subscribers do not use *delete*, sr_watch needs to
  know which files are new.  It does so by noting the time of the beginning of the last polling pass.
  File are posted if their modification time is newer than that.  This will result in many multiple posts
  by sr_watch, which can be minimized with the use of cache.   One could even depend on the cache
  entirely and turn on the *delete* option, which will have sr_watch attempt to post the entire tree
  every time (ignoring mtime)

**[-fs|--follow_symlinks <boolean>]**

The *follow_symlinks* option causes symbolic links to be traversed.  if *follow_symlinks* is set
and the destination of a symbolic link is a file, then that destination file should be posted as well as the link.
If the destination of the symbolic link is a directory, then the directory should be added to those being
monitored by sr_watch.   If *follow_symlinks* is false, then no action related to the destination of the symbolic 
link is taken.

**[-header <name>=<value>]**

Add a <name> header with the given value to advertisements. Used to pass strings as metadata in the
advertisements to improve decision making for consumers.  Should be used sparingly. There are limits
on how many headers can be used, and the minimizing the size of messages has important performance
impacts.

**[-h|-help|--help]**

Display program options.

**[-l <logpath>]**

Set a file where all the logs will be written.
Logfile will rotate at 'midnight' and kept for an history of 5 files.

**[-p|--path path]**

**sr_post** evaluates the filesystem path from the **path** option 
and possibly the **post_base_dir** if the option is used.

If a path defines a file this file is watched.

If a path defines a directory then all files in that directory are
watched... 

If this path defines a directory, all files in that directory are 
watched and should **sr_watch** find one (or more) directory(ies), it 
watches it(them) recursively until all the tree is scanned.

The AMQP announcements are made of the tree fields, the announcement time,
the **url** option value and the resolved paths to which were withdrawn
the *post_base_dir* present and needed.

**[-rn|--rename <path>]**

With the  *rename*   option, the user can
suggest a destination path for its files. If the given
path ends with '/' it suggests a directory path... 
If it doesn't, the option specifies a file renaming.

**[-sub|--subtopic <key>]**

The subtopic default can be overwritten with the  *subtopic*  option.

**[--sleep <time> ]**

The time to wait between generating events.  When files are written frequently, it is counter productive
to produce a post for every change, as it can produce a continuous stream of changes where the transfers
cannot be done quickly enough to keep up.  In such circumstances, one can group all changes made to a file 
in *sleep* time, and produce a single post.


**[-to|--to <destination>,<destination>,... ]** 

  A comma-separated list of destination clusters to which the posted data should be sent.
  Ask pump administrators for a list of valid destinations.

  default: the hostname of the broker being posted to.

.. note:: 
  FIXME: a good list of destination should be discoverable.

**[-tp|--topic_prefix <key>]**

By default, the topic is made of the default topic_prefix : version  *V02* , an action  *post* ,
followed by the default subtopic: the file path separated with dots (dot being the topic separator for amqp).
You can overwrite the topic_prefix by setting this option.

**[-u|--url <url>]**

The **url** option sets the protocol, credentials, host and port under
which the product can be fetched.

The AMQP announcememet is made of the tree fields, the announcement time,
this **url** value and the given **path** to which was withdrawn the *post_base_dir*
if necessary.

If the concatenation of the two last fields of the announcement that defines
what the subscribers will use to download the product. 




**[-sum|--sum <string>]**

All file posts include a checksum.  It is placed in the amqp message header will have as an
entry *sum* with default value 'd,md5_checksum_on_data'.
The *sum* option tell the program how to calculate the checksum.
It is a comma separated string.  Valid checksum flags are ::

    [0|n|d|c=<scriptname>]
    where 0 : no checksum... value in post is a random integer
          n : do checksum on filename
          d : do md5sum on file content (default for now, compatibility)
          s : do SHA512 on file content (default in future)

Then using a checksum script, it must be registered with the pumping network, so that consumers
of the postings have access to the algorithm.


DEVELOPER SPECIFIC OPTIONS
==========================

**[-debug|--debug]**

Active if *-debug|--debug* appears in the command line... or
*debug* is set to True in the configuration file used.

**[-r|--randomize]**

Active if *-r|--randomize* appears in the command line... or
*randomize* is set to True in the configuration file used.
If there are several posts because the file is posted
by block because the *blocksize* option was set, the block 
posts are randomized meaning that the will not be posted
ordered by block number.

**[-real|--realpath <boolean>]**  EXPERIMENTAL

The realpath option resolves paths given to their canonical ones, eliminating any indirection via symlinks.
The behaviour improves the ability of sr_watch to monitor trees, but the trees may have completely different paths than the arguments given. This option also enforces traversing of symbolic links.   This is implemented to preserve the behaviour of an earlier iteration of sr_watch, but it is not clear if it required or useful.  Feedback welcome.

**[-rr|--reconnect]**

Active if *-rc|--reconnect* appears in the command line... or
*reconnect* is set to True in the configuration file used.
*If there are several posts because the file is posted
by block because the *blocksize* option was set, there is a
reconnection to the broker everytime a post is to be sent.

**[--on_heartbeat]**

Every *heartbeat* seconds, the *on_heartbeat* is invoked.  For periodic operationsl that happen relatively rarely,
scale of many minutes, usually. The argument is actually a duration, so it can be expressed in various time units:  5m (five minutes),  2h (two hours), days, or weeks. 

**[--on_watch]**

Every *sleep* seconds, file system changes occurred are processed in a batch.  Prior to this processing,
the *on_watch* plugin is invoked.  It can be used to put a file in one of the watched directories... 
and have it published.  sleep is usually a much shorter interval than the heartbeat. It is also a 
duration, and so can be expressed in the same units as well.


CAVEATS
=======

Temporary Files
---------------

In order to avoid alerting for partially written (usually temporary) files, *sr_watch* does not post
events for changes to files with certain names:

 - files whose names begin with a dot **.**
 - files whose names end in .tmp

.. NOTE::
   FIXME: is this right?  need better does it ignore part files? should it?

Another file operation which is not currently optimally managed is file renaming. When a file is renamed
within a directory tree, sarracenia will simply announce it under the new name, and does not communicate
that already transferred data has simply changed name.  Subscribers who have transferred the data under the 
old name will transfer it again under the new name, with no relation being made with the old file.


Inotify Instance
----------------

Many linux systems have limits on how many directories can be watched that are set quite low, to minimize
kernel memory usage.  If you see a message like so::

    raise OSError("inotify instance limit reached")
    OSError: inotify instance limit reached

In that case, use adminsitrative privileges to set *sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_instance=<enough>* to a number 
that is big enough.  More kernel memory will be allocated for this, no other effects if changeing this setting are known.
