Small Simplifying Features

In addition to *thneed* work.  other small things.

- fix: force-polling broken since recent libsrshim work.


Remove:

 - 'flow' option should be removed, *header* has replaced it's function.

 - 'recursive' ... I think it is just always true.

 - *rename* functionality should be removed, as it is not used in practice.
   there was rename has a message header, and rename as an additional field on messages.
   both should be removed.  Should we iterate the version of version2 protocol?


Add:

*loghost* option.  To include the hostname in the logfile names.
           values:   Off|on|short|fqdn

          default off,  on== short,   fqdn=Fully qualified domain name.

   
Efficient file truncation support:
 
   to transmit a truncation...
   -- if new file is shorter than old file.
   -- calculate checksum of old file upto the length of the new file.
   -- if they match, then truncate file and done.


additional *actions* component x::

  start|stop            if no configs specified, then start all of x


  sr_subscribe add new.conf  mine.inc
          -> copies new.conf & mine.inc -> ~/.config/sarra/subscribe/new.conf


  add/remove        Add a config file by copying it from wherever to the right place.

  edit                     call up $EDITOR on the config file.

  log                      exec tail -f of the log file of the config file...
                          if instances >1  warn monitoring is easier with sr_report.
                          if an instance is specified, then tail -f of that instance's log

  list                      list all the files in the component's config directory.
     sr_subscribe
              new (enabled) instances: 5
       includes:
               mine.inc
  enable/disable     rename config file from .conf to .off
